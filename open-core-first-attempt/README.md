# vizhub-core
Work in progress... An experiment in adopting the [open-core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model) for VizHub. Feedback welcome!

## The Vision

 * Open Source core software wherein the hard problems are solved (best possible browser based runtime for live coding, importing from other vizzes, revision history, making the best possible code editor that _really_ works on mobile).
 * Proprietary plugins for paid features (collaborators with presence, teams, in-app live audio/video meeting experience).
