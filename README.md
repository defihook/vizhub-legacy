Goals:

- **Self-hosting** - It should be possible to self-host your own instance using 100% open source code.
- **Extensibility** - It should be possible to extend the core with plugins that add features.
- **Mobile UX** - It should be possible to develop interactive visual software on a smartphone.
- **Internationalization** - The interface should be in your local language, for the global VizHub audience.
- **Accessibility** - The UI should be accessible, fully navigable by keyboard and screen reader.

## Archive

This repository houses an archive of old code as a reference to draw from.

 * [archive/vizhub-v2](https://github.com/vizhub-open-core/vizhub/tree/main/archive/vizhub-v2) - The full source code for VizHub version 2, currently deployed at https://vizhub.com. No longer being developed as the codebase has become unwieldy. This will be the primary source of raw material to port/migrate/rewrite into VizHub CE.
 * [archive/open-core-first-attempt](https://github.com/vizhub-open-core/vizhub/tree/main/archive/open-core-first-attempt) - An attempt at a modular architecture. Notable features here include: Server rendering, Proper ShareDB hydration, and Markdown rendering in a Web worker
 * [archive/vizhub-v3-false-start](https://github.com/vizhub-open-core/vizhub/tree/main/archive/vizhub-v3-false-start) - An earlier false start at a VizHub rewrite. Notable features here include: Working PWA setup, new viz preview design, new home page design.
 * [archive/vizhub-v2-false-start](https://github.com/vizhub-open-core/vizhub/tree/main/archive/vizhub-v2-false-start) - An ancient effort. Notable features here include: CodeMirror 6 integration, dynamic code editor theming, fonts with ligatures.
