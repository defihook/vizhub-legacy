# VizHub

A platform for developing and publishing interactive visual programs.

## VizHub 2

VizHub version 2 is the product currently deployed at https://vizhub.com. Source code for this is located in the [vizhub-v2 directory](https://github.com/vizhub-core/vizhub/tree/main/vizhub-v2). This codebase will remain deployed for some time with maintenance fixes from time to time, but active development energy is going towards VizHub 3.

## VizHub 3

A re-write of VizHub is in progress, located in the [vizhub-v3 directory](https://github.com/vizhub-core/vizhub/tree/main/vizhub-v3). This is where active development is taking place.

Goals:

- **Self-hosting** - It should be possible to self-host your own instance using 100% open source code (and it should be useful).
- **Extensibility** - It should be possible to extend the core with plugins that add features.
- **Mobile UX** - It should be possible to develop interactive visual software on a smartphone.
- **Internationalization** - The interface should be in your local language, for the global VizHub audience.
- **Accessibility** - The UI should be accessible, fully navigable by keyboard and screen reader.
