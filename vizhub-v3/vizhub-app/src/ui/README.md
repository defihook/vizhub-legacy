# vizhub-app/src/ui

The idea behind this directory is to keep it simple and stupid, so that the UI by itself is easier to maintain in the long run.

The code in here should be purely "dumb components" that do not rely on any modules defined outside of this directory.

The code in here should not even be aware of the data structures provided by `vizhub-entities`.
