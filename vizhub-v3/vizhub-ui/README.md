# vizhub-ui

UI for the next generation of [VizHub](https://vizhub.com/).

## Package Scope

This package knows about UI, and nothing else. It is intentionally decoupled from any data structures or API, to keep this layer of the application simple and stupid.

## Development

This project is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).

Local development environment:

```
npm install
npm run build
cd build
http-server
```
